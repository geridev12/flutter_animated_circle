## ðŸŽ¨ Code Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project

### File Organization

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # Data models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ painters/        # Custom painters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ view/           # Widgets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ flutter_animated_circle.dart  # Main export
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `AnimatedCircleView`)
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase` (e.g., `strokeWidth`)
- **Constants**: `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `defaultDuration`)
- **Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `animated_circle_view.dart`)

### Documentation Standards

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Include examples in documentation
- Document all public classes, methods, and properties
- Use clear, concise language

Example:
```dart
/// A widget that displays an animated circle with configurable appearance.
///
/// This widget allows for customization of the circle's appearance through
/// [circlePainterConfig], animation timing through [duration], and styling
/// through [strokeWidth] and [borderWidth].
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// AnimatedCircleView(
///   circlePainterConfig: CirclePainterConfig.full(
///     fillColor: Colors.blue,
///     borderColor: Colors.blue.shade800,
///   ),
///   duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 800),
/// )
/// ```
class AnimatedCircleView extends StatefulWidget {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and logic
- **Widget Tests**: Test widget behavior and UI
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows (in example app)

### Writing Tests

1. **Test file naming**: `test/src/component/component_test.dart`
2. **Test organization**: Group related tests using `group()`
3. **Test naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the scenario
4. **Assertions**: Use meaningful assertion messages

Example:
```dart
group('CircleSegment', () {
  test('creates instance with correct properties', () {
    const segment = CircleSegment(
      fillColor: Colors.blue,
      borderColor: Colors.red,
      ratio: 0.5,
    );

    expect(segment.fillColor, Colors.blue);
    expect(segment.borderColor, Colors.red);
    expect(segment.ratio, 0.5);
  });

  test('throws assertion error for invalid ratio', () {
    expect(
      () => CircleSegment(
        fillColor: Colors.blue,
        borderColor: Colors.red,
        ratio: -0.1, // Invalid ratio
      ),
      throwsAssertionError,
    );
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/src/models/circle_segment_test.dart

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```
